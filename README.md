Welcome to my collection of solutions for various monthly online puzzles, including the Jane Street monthly puzzle. Whether you're here to learn, explore, or simply satisfy your curiosity, I hope you find value in these solutions.

Posting Guidelines
To maintain fairness and avoid spoilers, I follow these principles:
1. No Early Postings – Solutions will only be shared after they have been officially published on their respective websites.
2. Verified Solutions Only – Every posted solution is one I have personally solved in time to be listed among the official solvers. 
   No shortcuts, no cheating—just genuine problem-solving!

A Note on Formatting
This repository is still new, and some solutions have yet to be rewritten in a clean and structured format. Over time, I aim to refine and add them here, so stay tuned for updates!

Enjoy exploring the puzzles, and I hope you learn something along the way. Happy solving!
